## About me

I am an engineer with more than a decade of commercial experience covering a range of programming languages, roles, and team configurations, as well as a successful academic background. In all this I have shown myself to be adaptable – both socially and technically – and able to master a number of initially foreign concepts. I have the drive to see complex projects through to fruition, and am continuously seeking to expand my skill-set.

At present, I am on the Data Infrastructure team at Mesosphere Inc., where I work on taking the drudgery out of getting production-grade data services running at scale on DC/OS.

Before joining Mesosphere, I spent some time with Zalando SE as a research engineer -- working with data scientists at getting their machine learning models production ready. This included Zalando's fashion recommendation infrastructure.

I also worked as a developer on a commercial electromagnetic modelling and simulation software package at Altair Engineering (previously EM Software & Systems).
